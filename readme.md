DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT:

This project was developed as part of the 3rd CA for front-end web development and the 2nd CA on design for developers.
The website functions by suggesting a random meal to the user, allowing them to view the recipe upon selection. Similarly, when the user searches for specific meal categories,
the website displays meal options within the chosen category, with the same interactive functionality.
The primary objective of this assessment is to demonstrate proficiency in applying API integration within web applications.
